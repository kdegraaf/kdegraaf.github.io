# Hello, recruiters!

I'm Kevin DeGraaf, a Sr. DevOps Engineer based in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I'm actively looking for a new remote role anywhere in the United States.

* [Résumé](https://kdegraaf.github.io/resume/2021-02-26_Kevin_DeGraaf.pdf)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/kdegraaf)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinjdegraaf)

I would be glad to speak with you regarding the opportunity you have for me.  But first, I'd humbly request that you gather some information from the hiring manager to help me make an informed decision.  I would hate to waste your time discussing a role that's not a great fit.

## Must-haves

* 100% remote.  When COVID is completely over, I'd consider a small amount of travel.
* Direct FTE placement.  I'm not interested in third-party consultancy or contract-to-hire.
* Slack.  Sorry, but HipChat, Teams, RocketChat and IRC don't count.
* Company-provided Mac or Linux laptop, or permission to use my own.
* No laptop-crippling measures (e.g. forced use of a proxy, disabled split-tunneling, locked-out control panels).
* Some form of sandbox cloud account(s) available in which to develop infrastructure code without unreasonable restrictions.

## Nice-to-haves

* A team which is fully remote/distributed/WFH (even without COVID).  While I have been successful working as "the remote guy", my preference would be that _everyone_ is remote.
* Fully in Amazon Web Services.  I'll work in other clouds or in on-prem equipment too, but I'd prefer to leverage my time investment in AWS.

## Information I'd like

* Confirmation of the preceding points.
* A general sense of what to expect in the role.  I'll save the detailed questions for the interview, but if you would, just summarize the size and structure of the team, what the team does within the company, who its customers are, what a day is like, what on-call is like, and what sorts of deliverables would you expect from me in the short and medium terms.
* Compensation ballpark, just to make sure we're roughly aligned.

## Getting in touch

Thanks for reading this far.  If you [send me an email](mailto:kevin-recruiters@kdegraaf.net) with this information, I'll do my best to provide a prompt response either way.

Have a great day!
